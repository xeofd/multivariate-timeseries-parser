# multivariate-timeseries-parser

This is a technical assesment for NEL. It requires a program that can generate a 1 million row dataset of 3 randomly generated variables incremented in 1 second intervals. The dataset must then be parsed efficiently and plot the data along the time axis.

## Setup

To set up the program you will need to install the following pip packages:

```sh
> pip3 install pandas
```

```sh
> pip3 install matplotlib
```

```sh
> pip3 install watchdog
```

## Running the program

To run the program from the command line simply run the following command 

```sh
> python3 runner.py
```

Once the program is running you will be taken through some short questions about generating data and graphs.
